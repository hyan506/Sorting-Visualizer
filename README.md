# Sorting-Visualizer
This project is hosted here ===> http://hyan506.github.io/Sorting-Visualizer

This is a visualization tool for Sorting algorithms built using react.


## Algorithms implemented

#### Bubble Sort
The bubble sort is the first sorting algorithm to learn about. You wonâ€™t likely use it in the wild, as it is not very efficient.
#### Merge Sort
Merge sort is a divide and conquer algorithm that breaks an array into smaller pieces to operate on. Merge sort has better performance than the bubble sort.
#### Quick Sort
Quicksort is also a divide and conquer algorithm that uses recursion to perform its job, and often has better performance than Merge Sort.
